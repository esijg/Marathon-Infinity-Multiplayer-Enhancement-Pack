# About the Marathon Infinity Multiplayer Enhancement Pack v1.0

The original Marathon weapons were not really designed with people in mind. They were designed to be effective against slow and stupid aliens that could not dodge shots and could not operate their weaponry while they were being blasted by the player. Human players are a bit more intelligent, and faster than that.

This physics model addresses those changes and has undergone thorough balance testing during its development. Weapon switching delay is now nearly non-existant and random damage has been taken out of the game. Weapons that would normally never see action in an otherwise SPNKR filled multiplayer match can now go up against a SPNKR armed player under the right conditions.  

Enjoy **MIMEP**.

## Goals

- Strategic application of weapons. No dead guns. Every gun should serve a purpose.
- Eliminate randomness. It should be possible to estimate your opponents remaining health.
- Combine weapons to kill more effectively. Quick weapon switching.
- Balance. There should be no gun to rule them all. 

# The Weapons

## Fists
Fists are the same as before excluding Damage Random/Base change. Use them for the perfect humiliation effect at extreme close range.

## .44 Magnum Pistols
Pistols are now extremely easy to hit with. Use them to easily finish off a wounded opponent from mid to long range.

## MA-75B Assault Rifle
The assault rifle is now a lot more accurate than we have (grudgingly) grown accustomed to. The grenades are now nearly two times faster than previously which along with its accuracy makes it a lot more usable at short to mid range.

## SPNKR Rocket Launcher
No changes apart from Damage Base/Random changes. All around killer weapon for any situation although best at mid-range. Remember, Don't go running blindly into a battle with the SPNKR against other weapons as they are not the harmless pea shooters anymore you had grown accustomed to.

## Zeus Class Fusion Pistol
The Fusion Pistol is back, but this time inspired by the plasma pistol from Halo. The Bolts are now fast enough to actually make a difference, and secondary trigger now drains 260 health from your opponent, acting as a great way to take out opponents shields. Works well at short and mid range, in relatively flat areas.

Note that the secondary trigger has quite a kick for the unlucky receiver. It can stun him for a second or two so be quick to switch to a more fitting weapon to finish him off.

## TOZT-7 Flamethrower
No changes apart from Damage Base/Random adjustments. It is still a fearful weapon to be used at extreme close range.

## Alien Weapon
The speed increase now makes the alien weapon actually usable at short and mid range. And also makes it a good way to clear an area.

Secondary trigger now allows you to charge it up for an extremely fast and accurate high damage yield shot. It will cost you 1/3 of your ammo clip though.

## WSTM Shotguns
No changes apart from Damage Base/Random adjustments. The shotguns still work beautifully at close and mid range. Also fitting for long range if you are finishing off a wounded opponent.

## KKV-7 SMG Flechette
Still the good old SMG we've grown accustomed to although with slight damage/accuracy/speed changes.
