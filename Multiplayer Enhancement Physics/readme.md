# About the Marathon Multiplayer Enhancement Physics

## Goals

- Strategic application of weapons. No dead guns. Every gun should serve a purpose.- Eliminate randomness. It should be possible to estimate your opponents remaining health.- Combine weapons to kill more effectively. Quick weapon switching.- Balance. There should be no gun to rule them all.

# Changes

## Overall
- **Damage Random** set to **0** on all weapons. Therefor every weapon sees **base damage** increase by **1/2** of the original **damage random** value.
- **Ready time** (time between weapon switching) set to **1**.

## Fist
- **Damage Base** increased from **50** to **55**.

## Magnum Pistol
- **Damage Base** increased from **20** to **24**.
- **Radius** increased from **0** to **400**.
- **Recoil** decreased from **10** to **0**.

Pistols now act as a very good weapon to finish off a wounded opponent from distance.

## Plasma Pistol
- Primary Trigger
	- **Damage Base** increased from **30** to **45**.
	- **Speed** increased from **256** to **512**.
- Secondary Trigger
	- **Damage Type** set from **Fusion Bolt** to **Energy Drain**.
	- **Damage Base** increased from **30** to **260**.
	- **Speed** increased from **256** to **768**.

The plasma pistol is back. Bolts are now fast enough to actually make a difference, and secondary trigger now drains 260 health from your opponent, acting as a great way to take out opponents shields. Works well at short and mid range, in relatively flat areas.

## Assault Rifle
- Primary Trigger
	- **Theta Error** decreased from **10** to **7**.
	- **Damage Base** increased from **9** to **12**.
- Secondary Trigger
	- **Damage Base** decreased from **80** to **70**.
	- **Area of effect** increased from **768** to **1024**.
	- **Speed increased** from **256** to **400**.
	- **Double affected by gravity** box **checked**.
	
The assault rifle is now a lot more accurate than we have (grudgingly) grown accustomed to. The grenades are now nearly two times faster than previously which along with his accuracy makes it a lot more usable at short and mid range.

## Missile Launcher
- **Damage Base** increased from **250** to **275**.

## Flamethrower
- **Damage Base** increased from **8** to **10**.

## Alien Weapon
- **Damage Base** increased from **20** to **24**.
- Speed increased from **256** to **512**.

The speed increase now makes the alien weapon actually usable at short and mid range. And also makes it a good way to clear an area.

## Shotgun
- **Damage Base** increased from **20** to **22**.

## SMG
- **Automatic** checkbox **unchecked**.
- **Damage Base** increased from **9** to **253**.
- **Speed** increased from **1024** to **2048**.
- **Firing sound** changed from **"SMG firing (Inf only)"** to **"Cyborg Attack"**.
- **Rounds/magazine** changed from **32** to **1**.
- **Ticks/round** increased from **-1** to **15**.
- **Recovery Ticks** changed from **0** to **15**.
- **Recoil Magnitude** increased from **5** to **20**.
- **Theta error** decreased from **3** to **0**.
- **Burst count** decreased from **2** to **0**.

Probably the biggest change to the whole arsenal. The SMG is now a sniper with one bullet per magazine. Use them wisely.
